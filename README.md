# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction  
**CodSoft Internship – Task 1**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using **Machine Learning**.  
The goal is to build a robust classification model by performing **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** on the Titanic dataset.

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end ML workflow**, suitable for real-world data science applications.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and embarkation point,  
predict whether a passenger **survived (1)** or **did not survive (0)** the Titanic disaster.
